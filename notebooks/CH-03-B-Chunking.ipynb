    "En este notebook, repasarás los conceptos de tokens y chunking. En el notebook anterior (`CH-03-A-Grounding`), pudimos proporcionar algo de contexto adicional para fundamentar el modelo. ¿Existe un límite para la cantidad de contexto adicional que podemos proporcionar al modelo? Desafortunadamente, la respuesta es sí. Existe un límite para la cantidad de tokens permitidos en la entrada y la salida combinadas según el modelo que se esté utilizando.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entonces, ¿qué son los tokens? Los tokens son una representación de cómo los modelos de Azure OpenAI procesan el texto. Son palabras o simplemente fragmentos de caracteres. Veamos el número total de tokens en la respuesta que obtuvimos del primer notebook del Desafío 3. Hay muchas formas de calcular tokens. En este notebook, echaremos un vistazo a la biblioteca `tiktoken` para contar los tokens."

Si pensamos en nuestro escenario de Wimbledon, necesitaremos darle al modelo más contexto para ayudarlo a entender todo lo que necesita saber sobre el torneo. Más importante aún, todo lo que necesita saber para ayudar a responder tus preguntas al escribir el informe. Digamos que queremos proporcionar más contexto al modelo con un documento PDF. ¿Podemos intentar obtener un resumen del documento PDF para ayudarnos con nuestro trabajo?"

    "Acabamos de realizar algunas fragmentaciones utilizando Langchain, un framework popular para crear aplicaciones utilizando modelos de lenguaje grandes. En los métodos anteriores, viste varios ejemplos de chunking. Langchain puede ayudar a hacer que el proceso de chunking sea más fácil con algunos de sus métodos. Estos métodos incluyen fragmentos de tamaño fijo, así como la fragmentación recursiva, que acabamos de ver.\n",
